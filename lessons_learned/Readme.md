### Things I've Learned at Bloc.io:
1. How to use Git. I still feel like I need more practice on how to do this. Thankfully I know some one who is good at it.
2. Command lines. Same as above. This lesson was challenging and I'm going to try to spend some extra time working on it. A Slack help person sent me a link for more practice.
3. HTML. I've been exposed to some HTML stuff through Codeacademy and Udacity, but this was a great refresher. Plus I learned how to make a form, which I didn't do in the othe courses.
5. CSS. Similarly to HTML, I've been exposed to it prior with Codeacademy and Udacity, but Bloc dove into some more complex aspects of CSS I hadn't worked with before.
